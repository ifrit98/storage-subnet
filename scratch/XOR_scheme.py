To ensure that the prover uses the whole data `D` in each commitment while not overburdening the verifier with the need to keep a history of all seeds, you can modify the protocol slightly. The key is to require the prover to perform an operation that cryptographically combines the new seed with both the original data and the previous commitment or seed. This operation should be constructed in such a way that it cannot be computed without possessing the original data.

Here's a protocol that achieves this:

1. **Initial Commitment**:
   - The verifier sends the initial random seed `S0` to the prover.
   - The prover has data `D`.
   - The prover computes the initial commitment `C0 = hash(D || S0)` (where `||` denotes concatenation) and sends `C0` to the verifier.

2. **Subsequent Commitments**:
   - For each new challenge, the verifier sends a new random seed `Sn` to the prover.
   - The prover computes the new commitment as `Cn = hash(hash(D || S(n-1)) || Sn)` and sends `Cn` to the verifier.
   - The `hash(D || S(n-1))` part ensures that the prover must use the original data `D` in combination with the last seed `S(n-1)` to create the new commitment.
   - The prover only needs to store the latest seed `S(n-1)` between challenges, not the entire history of seeds.

3. **Verification**:
   - To verify `Cn`, the verifier takes the previous commitment `C(n-1)` (which they have stored) and checks it against `hash(hash(D || S(n-1)) || Sn)`.
   - The prover should provide the verifier with the `hash(D || S(n-1))` part (as a proof) and the new commitment `Cn`. The verifier can then check that `Cn = hash(proof || Sn)`.
   - If `Cn` matches the verifier's computation, it is assured that the prover used the correct `D` and `S(n-1)`.

4. **Continuing the Chain**:
   - The process repeats for each new challenge issued by the verifier, with each new commitment depending on the original data and the last seed, but the verifier only needs to keep the current seed and the last commitment.

In this revised protocol, the verifier does not need to keep all the seedsâ€”just the current seed and the last commitment. At the same time, the prover is required to use the original data `D` for every new commitment, ensuring that they continuously store the data.

It is crucial to note that for this to work as intended, the prover must not be able to precompute future commitments without receiving the next seed `Sn` from the verifier. Therefore, the verifier must ensure that seeds are unpredictable and securely communicated to the prover.

As with all cryptographic protocols, careful analysis is essential to ensure security. Such a protocol would need to be vetted for potential vulnerabilities, preferably by a security expert with experience in cryptographic protocols.

"""
In each round, the prover XORs the data D with the new seed Sn and then concatenates the result 
with the previous commitment C(n-1) before hashing to produce the new commitment Cn.

This makes Cn dependent on D, Sn, and C(n-1), meaning it requires knowledge of the original 
data and all previous seeds up to S(n-1).

For verification, the verifier would still only need the immediate previous seed and commitment.
